Design and Analysis of a Toroidal Propeller in Fusion 360

Objective:
To explore innovative propeller geometries that reduce noise and improve efficiency, while practicing advanced 3D CAD modeling techniques.

Background:
Traditional propellers generate noise due to tip vortices and turbulent wakes. The toroidal propeller, a recent breakthrough developed by MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, eliminates open blade tips by looping blades into a torus-like geometry. This reduces vortex shedding, leading to quieter and smoother propulsion â€” ideal for drones, AUVs, and robotics applications.

Methodology:
1. Researched toroidal propeller principles, including pitch and geometry.
2. Used Fusion 360 to model the geometry:
 - Created Profiles for the Blade Design
 - Made Loft from the Profiles
 - Built closed-loop blade profiles using circular patterns.
3. Design Parameters:
 - Diameter of Propeller : 55 mm
 - Blade Width: 0.5 mm
 - Hub Diameter: 5 mm
 - Pitch: 72.5 mm
 - Material: ABS(3D Printed)
4. Generated photorealistic renders and a simple rotation animation for visualization.

Key Learnings:
- Understanding of pitch-to-diameter ratio and its effect on thrust.
- Mastery of advanced CAD surfacing tools.
- Insights into noise reduction through design innovation.

Applications:
- Quieter UAV propellers.
- Silent underwater propulsion for AUVs/ROVs.
- Potential use in industrial fans and robotics.

Outcome:
Created a complete 3D CAD model of a toroidal propeller suitable for prototyping and further CFD/hydrodynamic analysis.
