# Design and Analysis of a Toroidal Propeller in Fusion 360

# Objective:
To explore innovative propeller geometries that reduce noise and improve efficiency, while practicing advanced 3D CAD modeling techniques.

# Background:
Traditional propellers generate noise due to tip vortices and turbulent wakes. The toroidal propeller, a recent breakthrough developed by MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, eliminates open blade tips by looping blades into a torus-like geometry. This reduces vortex shedding, leading to quieter and smoother propulsion â€” ideal for drones, AUVs, and robotics applications.

# Methodology:
<ol>
  <li>Researched toroidal propeller principles, including pitch and geometry.</li>
  <li>Used Fusion 360 to model the geometry:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Created Profiles for the Blade Design</li>
    <li>Made Loft from the Profiles</li>
    <li>Built closed-loop blade profiles using circular patterns.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Design Parameters:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Diameter of Propeller : 55 mm</li>
    <li>Blade Width: 0.5 mm</li>
    <li>Hub Diameter: 5 mm</li>
    <li>Pitch: 72.5 mm</li>
    <li>Material: ABS(3D Printed)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Generated photorealistic renders and a simple rotation animation for visualization.</li>
</ol>

# Key Learnings:
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of pitch-to-diameter ratio and its effect on thrust.</li>
  <li>Mastery of advanced CAD surfacing tools.</li>
  <li>Insights into noise reduction through design innovation.</li>
</ul>

# Applications:
<ul>
  <li>Quieter UAV propellers.</li>
  <li>Silent underwater propulsion for AUVs/ROVs.</li>
  <li>Potential use in industrial fans and robotics.</li>
</ul>

# Outcome:
Created a complete 3D CAD model of a toroidal propeller suitable for prototyping and further CFD/hydrodynamic analysis.
